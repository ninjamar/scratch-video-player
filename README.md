# Scratch Video Player

These are some scripts I used to generate the data from my [scratch video player](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/602626065/)


# Usage
First get a gif, then follow the directions in `conv.sh`. After running `conv.sh`, run `python3 make.py small.gif WIDTHxHEIGHT` replacing `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` appropriately. Upload the file `output.txt` to the list `data` in the scratch video player.
